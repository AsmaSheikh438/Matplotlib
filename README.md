# 📊 Matplotlib Visualization Techniques

Welcome to the **Matplotlib Visualization Techniques** repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to mastering data visualization using Matplotlib, featuring various plot types with real-world datasets.

## 🛒 Dataset Used
We have used the **Supermarket Sales Dataset**, which includes sales records from different branches, customer demographics, and purchase behavior. This dataset helps to visualize business insights effectively.

## 📈 Plots Covered

### 1. **Line Plot**
   - Used to display trends over time.
   - Example: Monthly sales trends.

### 2. **Bar Plot**
   - Used for categorical data comparison.
   - Example: Comparing total sales across different branches.

### 3. **Pie Chart**
   - Shows proportions within a dataset.
   - Example: Product category distribution.

### 4. **Histogram**
   - Visualizes the distribution of numerical data.
   - Example: Customer age distribution.

### 5. **Scatter Plot**
   - Shows relationships between two continuous variables.
   - Example: Relationship between total sales and customer ratings.

### 6. **Subplots**
   - Display multiple plots in one figure.
   - Example: Comparing different product categories across branches.

### 🚀 Features
- Step-by-step explanations of each plot type.
- Hands-on implementation using Python and Matplotlib.
- Practical insights with meaningful visualizations.
- Dataset included for practice.
